# MoPy package
MoPy package is a very powerful and efficient analysis toolbox for the bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) research. The most research of BFM contains the mean-square displacement (MSD) calculation, rotation bead in 2-dimensional fitting, image segmentation and bacteria profile measurement. However, when you collect tens to hundreds of thousands of data points or images, the analysis time is at least hours to days. MoPy package is developed with parallel computing, including GPU and vectorization. Researchers can easily use this package to process high-throughput data in minutes to hours.\
